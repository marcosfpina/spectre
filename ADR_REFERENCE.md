## 📖 Why Centralized?

Architectural decisions are maintained in the central `adr-ledger` repository for:

- **Cross-Project Visibility**: Decisions can be referenced by other projects (CEREBRO, PHANTOM, NEUTRON)
- **Governance**: Formal review and approval process
- **Traceability**: Complete audit trail of all architectural choices
- **Knowledge Management**: Centralized intelligence for the entire ecosystem

## 🚀 How to Propose New ADRs

For new SPECTRE architectural decisions:

1. Use the ADR MCP tools: `adr_new`, `adr_accept`
2. Or manually create in `adr-ledger/adr/proposed/`
3. Follow the ADR template structure
4. Submit for review and acceptance
